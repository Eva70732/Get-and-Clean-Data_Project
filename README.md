# Coursera Data Science: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In this repository you can find R code and supporting documents for the Course Project "Getting and Cleaning Data" provided by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera.

Data for analysis can be downloaded here:

## Documentation

*   run_anaysis.R file contains code to perform all analysis steps described in Project assignment.
    Save downloaded UCI HAR Dataset in working directory and run this .R file using R Studio
*   tidy_data.txt file is the final data table created by run_analysis.R code in Step 5
*   CodeBook.md contains all information about variables used in tidy_data.txt file

## Instructions

According to the Coursera Project assignment we should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
